# Rule 1 (Immutable)

All players in the game must obey all rules. A rule is defined as a
textual order or definition written in the Laws and Rules category.
There are three kinds of rules: phase, mutable, and immutable. In the
case of a contradiction, an immutable rule takes precedence over a
mutable rule, and in the case of both being mutable or immutable, the
rule with a lower ID number tales precedence. Phase rules have
precedence over any other rule, and if two phase rules contradict, B
class rules override S and E class rules, and lower digits have
precedence if both are B class.

# Rule 2 (Immutable)

Each player is assigned a place in the turn order, with new players
being put at the end of the turn order as they join. Turns rotate down
the turn order, and back to the top once the bottom player has taken
their turn. On a turn, a player may take one action. An action can be
either a proposal of a new law, in which case a law should be posted in
\#current-proposal, a mutable law can be proposed to be changed or
edited, a mutable law can be made immutable, an immutable law can be
made mutable, or another action determined by other laws than this one.
A public vote shall be held, and if a simple majority is reached in
favor of the action, the action is resolved as intended.

# Rule 3 (Immutable)

All players may vote at every opportunity, unless they are banned from
the server. Each player may vote once and only once, and each vote is
equal.

# Rule 4 (Immutable)

Each law is assigned a number, with each new law being one above the
previous one. A law may also be assigned a nickname. All laws, when
created, are mutable. A law can include multiple clauses, which may be
divided into sections within the law. All clauses should cover the same
topic. When calling an edit to an existing law as an action, the edit
should only relate to the topic of the law.

# Rule 5 (Immutable)

In the case of a law being broken, a Grand Trial may be called. In a
Grand Trial, a new category and text channels are created specifically
for the Grand Trial. The Grand Trial is called when a player accuses a
player or law of breaking a law with precedence, and another player
seconds them. The original accuser decides on a suitable punishment,
and all players decide if the punishment should be carried out. A simple
majority is needed in most cases, however, if the punishment is a
permanent banning from this server, two thirds or more is required to
pass the punishment. Players have a period of two turns to vote, and
turns proceed as normal during the Grand Trial.

# Rule 6 (Immutable)

Each player has a score called their 'point score', which will be
recorded next to their name in turn order. It can never be negative, and
if an action would  decrease it to negative, it instead decreases it to
0.

# Rule 7

A player's turn lasts 48 hours, and this timer begins at 1 'o clock pm
UTC. If a turn finishes early by reaching a majority vote, the next turn
begins at 1 o clock pm UTC the next day. If the 48 hours is reached and
no majority of players is reached, the majority of votes cast is done,
instead of majority of players, and the next turn begins. Players may
cede their turn to another player, allowing that player to make a
proposal in their stead.

# Rule 8

Failing to take an action, or cede your action, on your turn, will
result in a warning. If 3 warnings are called on a single player, a
Grand Trial for removal from the server commences. You may also choose
your cede up to your next 5 actions to a certain player, in advance,
in the case of prolonged absence. (Such as a vacation.)

# Rule 9

After a player's proposal is submitted and voted on, that player is
awarded with the amount of points (rounded up) which this equation
permits: [votes for/total votes*10]

# Rule 10

During the Game Phase, if one or more players passes 300 points at the
end of their turn, then they are considered a winner of that game. Once
at least one winner has been declared, the current round becomes the
Final Round for this Phase of the game. At the end of this round, all
players points are tallied, and any player (other than the first) whose
score exceeds 300 points is also considered a winner. After the Final
Round is over, the Game Phase ends and the End Phase begins.

# Rule 11

Your initial rule proposal must be the rule brought to vote. After you
post it, you canâ€™t modify it- no exceptions.

# Rule 12

Moderators and admins shall not recieve rewards or benefits in-game for
being an admin or moderator. They must carry out all rules and laws to
the best of their ability, and if the players believe they have not done
this, they may call a grand trial on the "Mod Team", where the
punishment is a method of resolving the problem. Also, \#server-rules
can be edited or added to at any time by mods or admins, however, rules
in it should only exist to help the server. Moderators and admins may
also carry out whatever steps they find necessary to keep peace and
well-being of the server, however, players may call a Grand Trial on a
mod or admin to remove their role, and while at trial, all of their mod
powers are revoked during the time of the trial.

# Rule 13

On their turn, a player may choose to spend 10 points from their point
score to shuffle the turn order. This will cause the turn order to be
randomised at the end of the round, however the player who initiated it
will be first in the new turn order. Only one player can do this per
round.

# Rule 14

## Section 1

Points are now the official currency of Now We Nomic. Certain roles may
recieve points as a salary for their work. Players may now 'donate'
their points or 'trade' their points. They may never do either of these
to put their point score negative, and if they would have negative
points, their donation or trade is reverted. A donation of points simply
subtracts that number of points from your account and gives it to
another player. They must first agree to recieve it. A trade is a
donation, in which is return for the other party doing an agreed upon
something, if both parties agree.

## Section 2:

A new role is created called the "Guardian of Estates", or GoE. All
donations and trades must be formalized with them first, and they make
sure the trade or donation is carried out freely. If one player tries to
not carry out their part of the deal, such as a player not performing
the action required by a trade, the GoE may choose to punish those
players by realloting points to those two players to a pre-trade state,
and subtracting up to 1/5th of trade's point value from the offending
party's account. A GoE is chosen by election every round, and cannot
hold more than two consecutive terms. An election lasts 72 hours, and
the player with the most votes at the end of that time wins. A GoE may
be removed from office by Grand Trial.
